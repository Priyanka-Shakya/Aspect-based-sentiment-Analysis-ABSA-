# Project Title - A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
# Description
This project presents a hybrid deep learning approach to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis using IMDB movie reviews. The model combines LSTM networks and other neural network components to accurately classify sentiment polarity with respect to specific aspects in textual data.
